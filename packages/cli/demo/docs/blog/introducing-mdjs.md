All shared code should have written documentation to show what it can be used for and what the idea behind it is.
Users should at least be able to get a high level understanding of what they are using, what they're using it for, and why.

On the web, we have many many different ways of writing documentation.
However, one thing almost all of them have in common is that they rely on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or some kind of variation of it.

And it's no surprise, because Markdown is supported practically everywhere (vscode, atom, github, gitlab, dev.to, npmjs, ...)

## For tools that do not run in the browser

In this case, you will mostly share code snippets that people will need to run in their own projects in which case traditional static site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), et al work great. All of them have full support for Markdown and allow you to easily create beautiful documentation pages with code snippets/highlighting, and more.

And frankly, if that is your use case almost everything you need should be possible with those tools as long as you feel comfortable with the ecosystem/framework.

## For (visual) components that do run in the browser

In this context, users probably do expect a live demo to see all the different options of your component in action. So pure Markdown is usually not enough as we now want to actually execute code and "insert" our working component in our documentation somehow. This would require specialized handling for each framework.

### Vue

For Vue, as an example, you can use VuePress which auto registers all Vue components in a certain folder and then you can use as normal HTML tags since Markdown supports HTML

```
.
â””â”€ .vuepress
  â””â”€ components
      â”œâ”€ demo-1.vue
```

```html
<demo-1 />
```

- supports vue components and has "magical" import for them
- no support for generic JavaScript or passing properties to components

### React

For React you can use [Mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) which extends Markdown with JSX support. Mdx is available via multiple tools like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [docz](https://www.docz.site/), [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), etc.

```md
import { Chart } from '../components/chart'

# Hereâ€™s a chart

The chart is rendered inside our MDX document.
<Chart />
```

- supports import/export JavaScript
- passes everything through JSX
- Doesn't look _great_ on github, requires special tools in editors to get highlighting

## Limitations

What all these specialized tools have in common is that they require a specific build tooling setup to work.
For web components, none of that is actually needed. Markdown already allows for HTML. The only missing piece is how to load a web component through JavaScript?

## Introducing Markdown with JavaScript (mdjs)

The primary goals are

- minimal complexity
- follows progressive enhancement
- stick close to valid markdown syntax
- code highlighting in editors without additional tools
- looks good on github/gitlab/any source code management tool

The fundamental idea seems almost too simple to be true. We "enhance" a code fence block with additional meta data `js script`.

    ```js script
    import './my-component.js';
    ```
    # This is my component
    <my-component></my-component>

And that's it! ðŸ˜„

Alright, enough talk, you can see it live here:

**How does it work**

mdjs hooks into [remark](https://remark.js.org/) and extracts all those tagged JavaScript blocks.
In the end, HTML and JS are separately available.

```js
{
  html: '<h1>This is my component</h1><my-component></my-component>',
  jsCode: "import './my-component.js';"
}
```

It can then be combined/processed by any tool to create an actual documentation page.

The process looks like this:

1. Extract `js script` and separate it from md
2. Render md
3. Provide HTML & JS

This already is powerful enough to directly include JavaScript and render web components with attributes.

## Enhancing mdjs with demo format

Now that we can execute JavaScript within our Markdown this opens the door for more advanced features.

Our first step is to create another enhanced js code block, namely; `js story`.
From this code block you can export a function to be executed on demand:

    ```js script
    import './my-component.js';
    ```
    # This is my component
    ```js preview-story
    export const demo = () => `<my-component header="from attribute"></my-component>`
    ```

> if you want to add a border around and a button to show/hide the actual source code you can use `js preview-story`

What you get looks something like this

```js
{
  html: '<h1>This is my component</h1><my-component></my-component>',
  jsCode: "import './my-component.js';",
  stories: [
    key: 'demo',
    name: 'demo',
    code: 'export const demo = () => `<my-component header="from attribute"></my-component>`',
  ]
}
```

Under the hood, this adds an extra step to the processing:

1. Extract `js script` and separate from md
2. Extract `js story` and `js preview-story` and separate from md
3. Put a placeholder `<mdjs-story mdjs-story-name="demo"></mdjs-story>` or `mdjs-preview` at it's place
4. Render markdown
5. Provide HTML, JavaScript, and stories

This is all the information we need to create full JavaScript and demo capable pages purely from markdown.

By default Mdjs takes it a small step further by supporting an actual template system - namely [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/).

    ```js script
    import './demo-wc-card.js';
    import { html } from 'lit-html';
    ```
    # This is my component
    ```js story
    export const demo = () => html`
      <demo-wc-card header="HEADER"></demo-wc-card>
    `;
    ```

Here another playground mimicking a full documentation page.

## mdjs default docs page

Once all this meta-information is available you can render a specific docs page.

It basically comes down to generating this code which assigns the demo function to the actual web component.

```js
const stories = [{ key: 'demo', story: demo, code: demo }];
for (const story of stories) {
  const storyEl = rootNode.querySelector(`[mdjs-story-name="${story.key}"]`);
  storyEl.story = story.story;
  storyEl.code = story.code;
}
```

All of this happens under the hood for you ðŸ¤—

## Where can you use mdjs?

### You can use it locally via es-dev-server

Here i'll show you how you can create a github like markdown view for all your local markdown files including live demos.

![es-dev-server screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-wc/blog-posts/master/2020-04-introducing-mdjs-interactive-demos-everywhere/images/es-dev-server-screenshot.png)

- Install es-dev-server as a dependency by running `npm i -D es-dev-server`

- Add the following script to your `package.json`:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "es-dev-server",
  }
  ```

- Create a `es-dev-server.config.js` in the root of your repo.

  ```js
  const { mdjsTransformer } = require('@mdjs/core');

  module.exports = {
    nodeResolve: true,
    open: 'README.md',
    watch: true,
    responseTransformers: [mdjsTransformer],
  };
  ```

After executing `npm run start` you can happily browse your live documentation via [http://localhost:8000/README.md](http://localhost:8000/README.md).

You can see an example setup in the [demo-wc-card repo](https://github.com/daKmoR/demo-wc-card).

### You can use it via Storybook

If you want to work on individual components or get a list of all demos you can use Storybook.

![storybook screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-wc/blog-posts/master/2020-04-introducing-mdjs-interactive-demos-everywhere/images/storybook-screenshot.png)

- Install dependency `npm i -D @open-wc/demoing-storybook`

- Add to your `package.json`:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "storybook": "start-storybook",
  }
  ```

- Adjust your `.storybook/main.js` to load markdown files

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    stories: ['../README.md', '../docs/**/*.md'],
    esDevServer: {
      nodeResolve: true,
      watch: true,
      open: true,
    },
  };
  ```

- Add to every markdown file that should be in storybook a name via

  ```js
  export default {
    title: 'My Group/My Awesome Component',
  };
  ```

And just like that, you are good to go.
No additional changes to any files are needed; a plugin will take care of everything by converting your markdown files to the support Storybook's mdx format.

For more detailed information please see [https://open-wc.org/demoing-storybook/](https://open-wc.org/demoing-storybook/).

### Show it on github

Since Github supports markdown out of the box, we can take things even further by using Mdjs.

![github screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-wc/blog-posts/master/2020-04-introducing-mdjs-interactive-demos-everywhere/images/github-screenshot.png)

As it's not supported by github directly you will need a chrome extension called [mdjs-viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mdjs-viewer/ifkkmomkjknligelmlcnakclabgohafe).

- Do you want to see a demo without opening a different page? mdjs-viewer!
- Do you want to show a live example of the issue you are having? mdjs-viewer!

Almost looks like black magic, huh?
All you did was install a Chrome extension and suddenly Github got superpowers.

All that you need is to have some Markdown files with the correct code fence blocks, and have your code up and running on [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com).

**How does it actually work?**

The extension detects which Github page you are on.
If it actually finds a markdown file or an issue with mdjs code then it adds a "show demo" button to activate it.
Only if you click the button it will start gathering all the needed info.

- find the nearest `package.json`
- read the actual markdown file/issue content
- replace all bare import with `unpkg.com` imports
- replace all relative imports with `unpkg.com` and the name of the package.json + relative path for it
- create a secured iframe
- position the iframe absolute as an overlays
- put the JavaScript and HTML code inside the iframe
- the button becomes a toggle to show/hide the iframe

Some of the tasks are more complicated and require some extra work to make it secure but in essence, that's it.

With that, you can put documentation with live examples on github.
Even issues with demos showing the actual error in the code are possible.

That sure sounds like a hell of a tool to improve your documentation an issue reproduction, doesn't it?
Especially as the readme and issue content still remain useful even without the extension.

For more detailed information please see [https://github.com/open-wc/mdjs-viewer](https://github.com/open-wc/mdjs-viewer).

### Supported on webcomponents.dev

Fully supported by this awesome online editor.

![webcomponent.dev screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-wc/blog-posts/master/2020-04-introducing-mdjs-interactive-demos-everywhere/images/webcomponents-dev-screenshot.png)

You can directly edit your documentation, demos and code directly in the browser.

![webcomponent.dev screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-wc/blog-posts/master/2020-04-introducing-mdjs-interactive-demos-everywhere/images/webcomponents-dev-new.png)

You can start directly with documentation as in the screenshot above, or even better you can use it in every Markdown file or README.md ðŸ’ª

Give it a go and document your components in all its glory.

All the demo links are actually from [webcomponents.dev](https://webcomponents.dev/edit/collection/lsZ2eaviDNwy6pIBEDeL/tS7JYfymt6yeshma8Gn1?pm=1&sv=1).

Be sure to [check it out](https://webcomponents.dev/).

## How you can add support for mdjs

Please check the official documentation page at [https://open-wc.org/mdjs/](https://open-wc.org/mdjs/).

## Resume

There you have it - mdjs is a format that can be shown in many different ways.
It is your single source of truth for good looking documentation everywhere.
Be it locally, a published storybook, on github or npmjs it always looks good even if there is no direct support for it, but when possible it will become interactive demos through progressive enhancement.

Now go out there and write good documentation for your components!

## Future

- Have a separate github repo (potentially group as well).
- Have a dedicated homepage
- The default story preview frame should look a little nicer
- Support multiple renderers - discussion in [issue](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc/issues/1498)
- Highlighting of code snippets
- More helpers to be used within stories
- ... (feel free to open issues within the corresponding projects)
