        It was unthinkable not long ago that a biologist or paleontologist would be at the same
        conference as an astrophysicist. Now we have accumulated so much data in each of these
        branches of science as it relates to origins that we have learned that no one discipline can
        answer questions of origins alone.

        The need to create a new taxonomy that isn't just applying to our own solar system will
        become so evident and apparent that something will come out of it. I'm sure of it, even if
        it's not tomorrow.

        You have people who believe they are scientifically literate but, in fact, are not. And I
        don't mind if you're not scientifically literate, but just admit that to yourself, so that
        you'll know, and perhaps you can take a first step to try to eradicate that.

      <div>
        Especially in the biography genre, they tend to focus on all the sordid details in the life
        of the person who made the discovery. I find this path to be voyeuristic but not
        enlightening.

    <span slot="summary">Once you have an innovation culture</span>
    <div>
      even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as
      communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate. They embrace the
      concept of an innovation culture. They vote in ways that promote it. They don't fight science
      and they don't fight technology.

      we didn't yet have a vehicle that wouldn't kill you on launch. He said we'll land a man on the

      the American people.
